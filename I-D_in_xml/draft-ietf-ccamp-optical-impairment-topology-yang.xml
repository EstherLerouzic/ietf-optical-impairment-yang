  <t> In order to provision an optical connection (an optical path)
   through a wavelength switched optical networks (WSONs) or spectrum
   switched optical networks (SSONs), a combination of path continuity,
   resource availability, and impairment constraints must be met to
   determine viable and optimal paths through the network. The
   determination of appropriate paths is known as Impairment-Aware
   Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) <xref target="RFC6566"/>
   for WSON, while it is known as IA-Routing and Spectrum Assigment
   (IA-RSA) for SSON.</t>

	<t>
   This document provides a YANG data model for the impairment-aware
   Traffic Engineering (TE) topology in WSONs and SSONs. The YANG model
   described in this document is a WSON/SSON technology-specific Yang
   model based on the information model developed in
   <xref target="RFC7446"/> and the two encoding documents
   <xref target="RFC7581"/> and <xref target="RFC7579"/> that developed
   protocol independent encodings based on <xref target="RFC7446"/>.</t>

	<t>
   The intent of this document is to provide a Yang data model, which
   can be utilized by a Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) to
   collect states of WSON impairment data from the Transport PNCs to
   enable impairment-aware optical path computation according to the
   ACTN Architecture <xref target="RFC8453"/>. The communication
   between controllers is done via a NETCONF <xref target="RFC8341"/>
   or a RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>. Similarly,this model can
   also be exported by the MDSC to a Customer Network Controller (CNC),
   which can run an offline planning process to map latter the services
   in the network.</t>

	<t>
   This document augments the generic TE topology draft
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo"/> where possible.</t>

	<t>
   This document defines one YANG module: ietf-optical-impairment-
   topology (<xref target="sect-3"/>) according to the new Network
   Management Datastore Architecture <xref target="RFC8342"/>.</t>

	<section title="OMS Media Links" anchor="sect-2.3"><t>
   According to <xref target="G.872"/>, OMS Media Link represents a media link between
   two ROADMs. Specifically, it originates at the ROADM's Filter in the
   source ROADM and terminates at the ROADM's Filter in the destination
   ROADM.</t>

	<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
OTS Media Link represents a media link:
(i)  between ROADM's BA and ILA;
(ii) between a pair of ILAs;
(iii) between ILA and ROADM's PA.
]]></artwork>
	</figure>
	<t>
   OMS Media link can be decomposed in a sequence of OTS links type
   (i), (ii), and (iii) as discussed above. OMS Media link would give
   an abstracted view of impairment data (e.g., power, OSNR, etc.) to
   the network controller.</t>

	<t>
   For the sake of optical impairment evaluation OMS Media link can be
   also decomposed in a sequence of elements such as BA, fiber section,
   ILA, concentrated loss and PA.</t>

	<section title="Optical Tributary Signal (OTSi)" anchor="sect-2.3.1"><t>
   The OTSi is defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.959.1, section 3.2.4
   <xref target="G.959.1"/>. The YANG model defined below assumes that a single OTSi
   consists of a single modulated optical carrier. This single
   modulated optical carrier conveys digital information.
   Characteristics of the OTSi signal are modulation scheme (e.g. QPSK,
   8-QAM, 16-QAM, etc.), baud rate (measure of the symbol rate), pulse
   shaping (e.g. raised cosine - complying with the Nyquist inter
   symbol interference criterion), etc.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Optical Tributary Signal Group (OTSiG)" anchor="sect-2.3.2"><t>
   The definition of the OTSiG is currently being moved from ITU-T
   Recommendation G.709 <xref target="G.709"/> to the new draft Recommendation G.807
   (still work in progress) [G.807]. The OTSiG is an electrical signal
   that is carried by one or more OTSi's. The relationship between the
   OTSiG and the the OTSi's is described in ITU-T draft Recommendation
   G.807, section 10.2 [G.807]. The YANG model below supports both
   cases: the single OTSi case where the OTSiG contains a single OTSi
   (see ITU-T draft Recommendation G.807, Figure 10-2) and the multiple
   OTSi case where the OTSiG consists of more than one OTSi (see ITU-T
   draft Recommendation G.807, Figure 10-3). From a layer 0 topology
   YANG model perspective, the OTSiG is a logical construct that
   associates the OTSi's, which belong to the same OTSiG. The typical
   application of an OTSiG consisting of more than one OTSi is inverse
   multiplexing. Constraints exist for the OTSi's belonging to the same
   OTSiG such as: (i) all OTSi's must be co-routed over the same
   optical fibers and nodes and (ii) the differential delay between the
   different OTSi's may not exceed a certain limit. Example: a 400Gbps
   client signal may be carried by 4 OTSi's where each OTSi carries
   100Gbps of client traffic.</t>

   The definition of the MC is currently being moved from ITU-T
   Recommendation G.872 <xref target="G.872"/> to the new draft Recommendation G.807
   (still work in progress) [G.807]. Section 3.2.2 defines the term MC
   and section 7.1.2 provides a more detailed description with some
   examples. The definition of the MC is very generic (see ITU-T draft
   Recommendation G.807, Figure 7-1). In the YANG model below, the MC
   is used with the following semantics:</t>

	<t>
   The MC is an end-to-end topological network construct and can be
   considered as an "optical pipe" with a well-defined frequency slot
   between one or more optical transmitters each generating an OTSi and
   the corresponding optical receivers terminating the OTSi's. If the
   MC carries more than one OTSi, it is assumed that these OTSi's
   belong to the same OTSiG.</t>

	<t>
   The frequency slot of the MC is defined by the n value defining the
   central frequency of the MC and the m value that defines the width
   of the MC following the flexible grid definition in ITU-T
   Recommendation G.694.1 <xref target="G.694.1"/>. In this model, the effective
   frequency slot as defined in ITU-T draft Recommendation G.807 is
   equal to the frequency slot of this end-to-end MC. It is also
   assumed that ROADM devices can switch MCs. For various reasons (e.g.
   differential delay), it is preferred to use a single MC for all
   OTSi's of the same OTSiG. It may however not always be possible to
   find a single MC for carrying all OTSi's of an OTSiG due to spectrum
   occupation along the OTSiG path.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Media Channel Group (MCG)" anchor="sect-2.3.3"><t>
   The definition of the MCG is currently work in progress in ITU-T and
   is defined in section 7.1.3 of the new ITU-T draft Recommendation
   G.807 (still work in progress) [G.807]. The YANG model below assumes
   that the MCG is a logical grouping of one or more MCs that are used
   to to carry all OTSi's belonging to the same OTSiG.</t>

	<t>
   The MCG can be considered as an association of MCs without defining
   a hierarchy where each MC is defined by its (n,m) value pair. An MCG
   consists of more than one MC when no single MC can be found from
   source to destination that is wide enough to accommodate all OTSi's
   (modulated carriers) that belong to the same OTSiG. In such a case
   the set of OTSi's belonging to a single OTSiG have to be split
   across 2 or more MCs.</t>

  The MCG is relevant for path computation because all end-to-end MCs
  belonging to the same MCG have to be co-routed, i.e., have to follow
  the same path. Additional constraints may exist (e.g. differential
  delay).

	<section title="Amplifiers" anchor="sect-2.4"><t>
   Optical amplifiers are in charge of amplifying the optical signal in
   the optical itself without any electrical conversion. There are
   three main technologies to build amplifiers: Erbium Doped Fiber
   Amplifier (EDFA), Raman Fiber Amplifier (RFA), and Semiconductor
   Optical Amplifier (SOA). Nowadays, most of optical networks uses
   EDFAs. However, RFA has an attractive feature that it works in any
   wavelength band with a similar or lower noise figures compared to
   EDFA. On the other hand, RFAs consumes more power and are more
   expensive than EDFAs.</t>

	<t>
   Amplifiers can be classified according to their location in the
   communication link. There are three basic types of amplifiers: ILA,
   Pre-Amplifier and Booster. ILA is In-Line Amplifier which is a
   separate node type while Pre-Amplifier and Booster Amplifier are
   integral elements of ROADM node. From a data modeling perspective,
   Pre-Amplifier and Booster Amplifier are internal functions of a
   ROADM node and as such these elements are hidden within ROADM node.
   In this document, we would avoid internal node details, but attempt
   to abstract as much as possible.</t>

	<t>
   One modeling consideration of the ROADM internal is to model power
   parameter through the ROADM, factoring the output power from the
   Pre-Amplifier minus the ROADM power loss would give the input power
   to the Booster Amplifier. In other words, Power_in (@ ROADM Booster)
   = Power_out (@ ROADM Pre-Amplifier) - Power_loss (@ ROADM
   WSS/Filter).</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Transponders" anchor="sect-2.5"><t>
   A Transponder is the element that sends and receives the optical
   signal from a fiber. A transponder is typically characterized by its
   data rate and the maximum distance the signal can travel. Channel
   frequency, per channel input power, FEC and Modulation are also
   associated with a transponder. From a path computation point of
   view, the selection of the compatible source and destination
   transponders is an important factor for optical signal to traverse
   through the fiber. There are three main approaches to determine
   optical signal compatibility. Application Code based on G.698.2 is
   one approach that only checks the code at both ends of the link.
   Another approach is organization codes that are specific to an
   organization or a vendor. The third approach is specify all the
   relevant parameters explicitly, e.g., FEC type, Modulation type,
   etc.</t>

	<t>
   [Editor's Note: The current YANG model described in Section 3 with respect to the relationship between the transponder attributes and the OTSi will need to be investigated in the future revision]</t>

	</section>

	<section title="WSS/Filter" anchor="sect-2.6"><t>
   WSS separates the incoming light input spectrally as well as
   spatially, then chooses the wavelength that is of interest by
   deflecting it from the original optical path and then couple it to
   another optical fibre port. WSS/Filter is internal to ROADM. So this
   document does not model the inside of ROADM.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Optical Fiber" anchor="sect-2.7"><t>
   There are various optical fiber types defined by ITU-T. There are
   several fiber-level parameters that need to be factored in, such as,
   fiber-type, length, loss coefficient, pmd, connectors (in/out).</t>

	<t>
   ITU-T G.652 defines Standard Singlemode Fiber; G.654 Cutoff Shifted
   Fiber; G.655 Non-Zero Dispersion Shifted Fiber; G.656 Non-Zero
   Dispersion for Wideband Optical Transport; G.657 Bend-Insensitive
   Fiber. There may be other fiber-types that need to be considered.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="ROADM Node Architectures" anchor="sect-2.8"><t>
   The ROADM node architectures in today's dense wavelength division
   multiplexing (DWDM) networks can be categorized as follows:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
	<t>Integrated ROADM architecture with integrated optical transponders</t>

	<t>Integrated ROADM architecture with integrated optical transponders
      and single channel add/drop ports for remote optical transponders</t>

	<t>Disaggregated ROADM architecture where the ROADM is subdivided
      into degree, add/drop, and optical transponder subsystems handled
      as separate network elements</t>

	<?rfc subcompact="no"?>
	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
   The TE topology YANG model augmentations including optical
   impairments for DWDM networks defined below intend to cover all the
   3 categories of ROADM architectures listed above. In the case of a
   disaggregated ROADM architecture, it is assumed that optical domain
   controller already performs some form of abstraction and presents
   the TE-node representing the disaggregated ROADM in the same way as
   an integrated ROADM with integrated optical transponders if the
   optical transponder subsystems and the add/drop subsystems are
   collocated (short fiber links not imposing significant optical
   impairments).</t>

	<t>
   The different ROADM architectures are briefly described and
   illustrated in the following subsections.</t>

	<t>
   [Editor's Note: The modeling of remote optical transponders located for example in the client device with a single channel link between the OT and the add/drop port of the ROADM requires further investigations and will be addressed in a future revision of this document.]</t>

	<section title="Integrated ROADM architecture with integrated transponders" anchor="sect-2.8.1"><t>
   Figure 2 and Figure &lt;A1&gt; below show the typical architecture of an
   integrated ROADM node, which contains the optical transponders as an
   integral part of the ROADM node. Such an integrated ROADM node
   provides DWDM interfaces as external interfaces for interconnecting
   the device with its neighboring ROADMs (see OTS link above). The
   number of these interfaces denote also the degree of the ROADM. A
   degree 3 ROADM for example has 3 DWDM links that interconnect the
   ROADM node with 3 neighboring ROADMs. Additionally, the ROADM
   provides client interfaces for interconnecting the ROADM with client
   devices such as IP routers or Ethernet switches. These client
   interfaces are the client interfaces of the integrated optical
   transponders.</t>

   Figure &lt;A2&gt; below shows the extreme case where all optical
   transponders are not integral parts of the ROADM but are separate
   devices that are interconnected with add/drop ports of the ROADM. If
   the optical transponders and the ROADM are collocated and if short
   single channel fiber links are used to interconnect the optical
   transponders with an add/drop port of the ROADM, the optical domain
   controller may present these optical transponders in the same way as
   integrated optical transponders. If, however, the optical
   impairments of the single channel fiber link between the optical
   transponder and the add/drop port of the ROADM cannot be neglected,
   it is necessary to represent the fiber link with its optical
   impairments in the topology model This also implies that the optical
   transponders belong to a separate TE node [Editor's Note: this requires further study].</t>

	<section title="Disaggregated ROADMs that are subdivided into degree, add/drop, and optical transponder subsystems" anchor="sect-2.8.3"><t>
   Recently, some DWDM network operators started demanding ROADM
   subsystems from their vendors. An example is the OpenROADM project
   where multiple operators and vendors are developing related YANG
   models. The subsystems of a disaggregated ROADM are: single degree
   subsystems, add/drop subsystems and optical transponder subsystems.
   These subsystems separate network elements and each network element
   provides a separate management and control interface. The subsystems
   are typically interconnected using short fiber patch cables and form
   together a disaggregated ROADM node. This disaggregated ROADM
   architecture is depicted in Figure &lt;A3&gt; below.</t>

	<t>
   As this document defines TE topology YANG model augmentations <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo"/> for the TE topology YANG model provided at the north-bound
   interface of the optical domain controller, it is a valid assumption
   that the optical domain controller abstracts the subsystems of a
   disaggregated ROADM and presents the disaggregated ROADM in the same
   way as an integrated ROADM hiding all the interconnects that are not
   relevant from an external TE topology view.</t>
