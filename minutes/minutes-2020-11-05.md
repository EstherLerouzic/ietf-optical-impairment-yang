## Notes

### Uploading version 05

A new version of the draft (05) aligned with the new YANG present 
in the github https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang has been uploaded November 2nd.
The draft contains also new section 2.5 describing Transponder model.

### New doodle

A new doodle has been sent to the weekly call attendees to find a new slot to solve the overlapping issue by G. Galimberti.


### Raw Examples of configurations

Gert raised the point related to a comment in the github https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/29#issuecomment-721932874 and attendees agree on the need to add some text in the future version to clarify "precedence/priority" in the modes to avoid overlapping between parameters that are implicit in a mode (like what happen always for ITU-T application code) and explicit parameters.
Below some examples discussed.

#### 1) Application code and Explicit mode

Transponder A)
- application-code X
  - fmin=50 (implicit)
- explicit-mode Y
  - fmin=10
  - supports application-code X
  
Transponder B)
- application-code X
- explicit-mode Z
  - fmin=30
  - supports application-code X

Transponder C)
- application-code X


application-code X: f>=50

explicit-mode (A.Y-B.Z): f>=30

##### Side note

Referring to fmin range, the explicit paramteres for an explicit mode that supports an application-code are the same or less constraining that the implicit parameters of the supported application code

Example: transponder supports

- application-code X: 10-50
- application-code Y: 30-80
- explicit-mode Z: 10-80
  - can support X and/or Y
- explicit-mode K: 20-80
  - can support Y but __cannot__ support X

If a client decide to configure transceiver with explicit-mode K, with f min = 20 , he can , but due to the fact application-code Y is tested with range 30-80, there is no garantee of interoperability with f min = 20.
No overlapping.

#### 2) Organization mode (explicit) and Explicit mode

Transponder A)
- organizational-mode Org1.X (fmin is not implicitly defined)
  - fmin=50
- explicit-mode Y
  - fmin=10
  - supports organizational-mode Org1.X
  
Transponder B)
- organizational-mode Org1.X (fmin is not implicitly defined)
  - fmin=40
- explicit-mode Z
  - fmin=30
  - supports organizational-mode Org1.X

Transponder C)
- organizational-mode Org1.X (fmin is not implicitly defined)
  - fmin=20

No overlapping.

organizational-mode Org1.X:
- A-B: f>=50
- A-C: f>=50
- B-C: f>=40

explicit-mode (A.Y-B.Z): f>=30

#### 3) Organization mode (implicit) and Explicit mode

Transponder A)
- organizational-mode Org2.X
  - fmin=50 (implicit)
  - __fmin=10 (explicit) - should not be done (for further discussion)__
- explicit-mode Y
  - fim=10
  - supports organizational-mode Org2.X
  
Transponder B)
- organizational-mode Org2.X
  - fmin=50 (implicit)
- explicit-mode Z
  - fmin=30
  - supports organizational-mode Org2.X

Transponder C)
- organizational-mode Org2.X
  - fmin=50 (implicit)


organizational-mode Org2.X: f>=50

explicit-mode (A.Y-B.Z): f>=30

This case , with organizational-mode "implicit", is similar to application-code, and if a client decide to configure transceiver with "exlicit mode" f>=30, there is no guarantee of interoperability that is tested with f>=50.
If an organizational-mode is based on an "implicit" parmaeters only, should not be permitted to expose a set of parameters , e.g. power ranges,in the organizational-mode.

### Reference to flexgrid and wson model

Victor/Julien: need to reference flexgrid and wson model and how they can work with this model.

__AP: Victor__ to create specific issue and suggest text for the draft.

This is pending issue. Need to discuss when Victor is present
