## C+L band discussion  

Italo uploaded at https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/46#issuecomment-767559764
the possible model as outcome of the discussion. 

There is agreement to follow the proposal summarized by Italo below.

Dieter: prposed changes on the names of the frequency for frequency-range related to amplifier band: lower-frequecy, upper-frequency instead of fmin, fmax

We need to clearly define (in the "description" YANG statement and within the draft text) the reference points where the power attributes apply.

## Added new issue about C+L band for ROADM #51
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/51

Dieter added a new issue, #51.

Gert: remove sub-tree in the description of the issue. No sub-tree for C and L band
AP@Dieter: he will modify the text accodingly.

## New pull request in github

### PR#50 Simplify the tree using suggestion as PR#22
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/pull/50

There was discussion about the importance to take "type" in the definition of OMS-elements in YANG to"query a single parameter to know the node type and take appropriate actions" following Ahiua's comment https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/21#issuecomment-509379477

But having the name of container (amplifier, fiber, concentrated-loss) you can get anyway the type of element. 

2 suggested modifications:
-Put loss as "mandatory true"
-Put "mandatory true" in the choice of element in OMS-elements list

PR#50 : approved


## PR#47 Adding first tests
adding travis yml for automatic testing
addind a test that compares autocreated tree with uploaded one
automatically downloads reference yang from official repos (layer0-ext is
not yet in the official yang repo, I download it from its github repo)

PR#47 : approved
