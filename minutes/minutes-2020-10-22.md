Notes
-G. Galimberti weekly call partecipation

To find a solution about the partecipation of Gabriele Galimberti to weekly call,
it was proposed to make another Doodle with
also slots in early afternoon (2-4 CET time)

-Plan for new version uploading before IETF-109

YANG model with transponder model part has been just merged in master branch of github https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang.
Ready to be included in the draft.
Need to review transponder mode related text proposal https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/29#issuecomment-702148542

AP for next week in order to be on time (November 2nd) to upload the draft

Esther: to add table for explicit mode in the text
Dieter: to include YANG in the draft
all: review text

-Reference to flexgrid and wson model

Victor/Julien: need to reference flexgrid and wson model and how they can work with this model.
AP: Victor to create specific issue and suggest text for the draft.

-ITU-T reference definitions

Gert/Dieter/Sergio/Italo/Esther:
There is the need to clarify better some attributes definitions, aslo in relation to ITU-T reference definitions not clear.
Carrier-bandwidth: is introduced in our model with one definiton but there is no standard ITU-T definition.
Minimum-channel-spacing: ITU-T definiton does not clarify if the minimum distance is between media channels or signals.
AP: Dieter to verify with internal company ITU-T Q6 expert

-Update in layer0-types-ext module

AP: Sergio to add issue in layer0-types-ext github to modify unit in the available-baudrate attribute
Use GBd not Bd
Actual definition : units Bd;

-Update proposed by Gabriele issue #42 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/42#issue-723273471

Need to have clear definitions of attributes : AP Gabriele
Esther: Minimum Channel Spacing and (baud-rate + roll-off + nyquist-spacing + xtalk-penalty) are not in alternative since it would still need baudrate and roll off values to compute path performance,
independently to use these attributes to compute min channel spacing.
