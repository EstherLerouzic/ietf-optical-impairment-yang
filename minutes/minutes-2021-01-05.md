## Review text proposed by Italo on interoperability

The text proposed by Italo and uploaded on github at  https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/43#issuecomment-754513792, has been reviewd and an agreed version is on the github at https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/43#issuecomment-754678382.

## Review text proposed by Italo and Haomian in section 2.5.x
The attendees review the last version of the text proposed by Italo and Haomian,taking into account also the comments provided by Esther. The text is uploaded in github at https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/43#issuecomment-754515092.
A first comment by esther was realted to "Standard" term used , and during the call was agreed new text to underline the fact the "current"  version of the draft is referring "standard mode" realted only to ITU-T G.698.2 , sicne it is the only standard present in the marke but this does preclude the intention to model other standards, whene defined, as standard modes.
Some new text has been added related to this issue.
Another comment from Esther was on the "too much emphasize on the interop pocess " in the proposed text and there was agreement that a general review of the text is needed to be considered.

Moreover to address another comment from Esther about possible restriction range used for the explicit parameters of the organizational model (frequency and power range) a new text will be added.
